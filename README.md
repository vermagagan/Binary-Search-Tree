# Binary Search Tree Practice Repository

Welcome to the Binary Search Tree Practice Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Binary Search Tree (BST) questions that I've practiced to enhance my understanding and proficiency in using BSTs.

## About Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node. BSTs are used in various applications, including searching, sorting, and maintaining a dynamic set of ordered elements.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you've solved a Binary Search Tree problem that's not included here, feel free to submit a pull request with your solution implementation along with test cases.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue in the repository. I'll do my best to address it promptly.
